Thought you might like some pictures of the new car, It's a 2009 Nissan X-Trail, 6 Speed Automatic 2litre Petrol Engine. As you can see by the photos It's the only 4WD where the seats fold down properly to allow you to sleep in the back. It also has these great storage drawers so that if any one takes a look in the boot it looks empty and small stuff stored stops flying around. Leslyn is a great fan of the Heated Seats when we are up early, the stereo is a touch screen and changes to a reversing camera when you shift to reverse. 4WD is much easier than the Escudo, no gear changing necessary. She has beautiful leather seats and can comfortably fit five for when I'm transporting the girls from the running club. With only a 2 Litre Engine shes very economical, very smooth over the Christchurch pot-holes with the long wheelbase and the clearance although not super has stopped me getting her stuck so far!  She came with road tires, but a set of A/T's would raise her up a few inches. There are safari lights in the roof rack which are fantastic off road, being bright enough to be seen in space and angled to make setting camp up in the dark nice and easy. 

Lots of Love
Jason and Leslyn
