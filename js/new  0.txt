1. Explain why stakeholder diversity is an important consideration for CMer and how audience analyses can be undertaken
The organisational structure
- the division of labour 
- associated range of trades, professions, skilled workers
- the levels in the hierarchy
- recruitment policies and practices
Demographics of the workforce
- gender, age, ethnicity, religious beliefs, experience etc.
Demographics of the client/customer base
- gender, age, ethnicity, religious beliefs, location
Audience is a surprisingly complicated concept
-May not be in the same time frame
-Or even have a sense of being an audience member
-Have varying objectives and expectations
-May not be entirely present
-Individuals’ attributes may not be stable over time
Types of audience (CBM pp. 272-74)
-Active/passive
-Invoked/addressed
-Captive/voluntary
-Lay/expert - Will have differences in skill and knowledge
-Hostile/receptive
-Indigenous
-Homogenous/heterogeneous (not in CBM)
HOW TO UNDERTAKE AUDIENCE ANALYSIS
How can you get to know your audience’s demographics, psychology and contexts?
Direct techniques – surveys, online forums, Facebook pages,  discussion groups, focus groups, 
Indirect techniques – examining what they read, listen to or consume, researching the groups they belong to, asking third parties about them
How safe is it to use demographic data like age distribution, gender, occupation, socio-economic group or culture to define audience diversity?

Use 
Immediacy
-Refers to social and psychological closeness (See CBM p. 275)
-Sense of connection
-High immediacy leads to interpersonal comfort
-Immediacy behaviours reduce social and psychological distance
-Is immediacy as achievable with an online audiences as it is with face-to-face (FTF)?

Source Credibility
-Is an audience judgment about a speaker or writer
-Addresses veracity/trustworthiness, expertise and goodwill
-Even avatars get judged in terms of these dimensions 

Rhetorical Sensitivity
-Willingness to tailor messages to the audience
-‘Noble selves’ make no adjustments
-‘Rhetorical reflectors’ mimic their audience
-The rhetorically sensitive person is somewhere in between 
What is gained by being rhetorically sensitive?

Audience Prep Principles
1) Expect and prepare for diversity
2) Be data driven
3) Approach audiences on their own terms
4) Interact with your audience
5) Interpret your objectives and actions
6) Seek to create a community of common interest

10) Keep media in its place
			
			
	



2. Identify ways in which discrimination can occur and how corporate image management can be related to discrimination
	Is an issue that needs to be considered alongside all aspects of workplace activity
	Considerable potential exists for discrimination to occur (e.g., when providing advice on the content of job descriptions and advertisements
	Human Rights Act 1993 (HRA) is the ‘fair go’ act : Must not discriminate in terms of sex, marital status, religious belief, colour, race, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, political opinion, employment status, family status or sexual orientation
	Areas: employment and pre-employment, supply of goods and services, education, access to public places, vehicles and facilities, and housing and accommodation
	
Stereotypes
-Generalizations - assume homogeneity
-Over-emphasize particular attributes
-Slow to adjust to changing times
-Become self-fulfilling prophesies
What stereotypes feed discrimination of
-youth?
-elders?
How can the way we approach an audience lead to discrimination?
-Content of messages
-Timing
-Venue
-Resources
-Advertising
	
	
	
3. Begin thinking about some of the legal and treaty issues CMers must be concerned with
4. Summary
-The starting point - the CM needs to know themselves
-Audience-centered so communication is tailored
-Never underestimate the complexity of CM
See chpt 11 for principles for preparing for audiences
-CM responsibilities can be broad
+Both internal and external
+Operational (e.g., writing press releases)
+Advisory
Monitoring 
+Standard setting
+Ensuring compliance
Practices vary but information and impression management,  auditing (quality assurance) and networking(relationship management) are key practices
Stakeholder diversity, law, ethics and CSR key issues that shape practices
